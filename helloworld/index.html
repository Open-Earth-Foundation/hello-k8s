    <ul>
      <li>
        EP: change the EKS deployment action so it uses the same config as for
        the local deployment.
      </li>
      <li>
        EP: slightly rearranged the GitHub Actions file so I can tell the jobs
        and steps apart
      </li>
      <li>
        EP: Added a second replica, which I think makes the rollout have less
        downtime.
      </li>
      <li>
        EP: Updated the rollout call when pushing so it restarts the deployment
      </li>
